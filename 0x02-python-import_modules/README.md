## Basic info

A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. The file name is the module name with the suffix .py appended. Within a module, the modules name (as a string) is available as the value of the global variable __name__.

A module can contain executable statements as well as function definitions. These statements are intended to initialize the module. They are executed only the first time the module name is encountered in an import statement.

Modules can import other modules.
