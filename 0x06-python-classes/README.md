# 0x06. Python - Classes and Objects

> This directory contains all the tasks of the project "0x06. Python - Classes and Objects" at [Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.com "Holberton School.") for educational purpose.

## General Objectives

* What is the difference between a class and an object or instance.
* What is an attribute.
* What are and how to use public, protected and private attributes.
* What is self.
* What is a method.
* What is the special __init__ method and how to use it.
* What is Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding.
* What is a property.
* What is the difference between an attribute and a property in Python.
* What is the Pythonic way to write getters and setters in Python.
* How to dynamically create arbitrary new attributes for existing instances of a class.
* How to bind attributes to object and classes.
* What is and what does contain __dict__ of a class and of an instance of a class.
* How does Python find the attributes of an object or class.
* How to use the getattr function.

## Basic info

### Object Oriented Programming

OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects" which can contain data, in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods). 
* Classes - the definitions for the data format and available procedures for a given type or class of object; may also contain data and procedures (known as class methods) themselves, i.e. classes contain the data members and member functions.
* Objects - instances of classes, sometimes correspond to things found in the real world. For example, a graphics program may have objects such as "circle", "square", "menu". An online shopping system might have objects such as "shopping cart", "customer", and "product".
* Class variables - belong to the class as a whole; there is only one copy of each one.
* Instance variables or attributes  data that belongs to individual objects; every object has its own copy of each one.
* Member variables - refers to both the class and instance variables that are defined by a particular class.
* Class methods - belong to the class as a whole and have access only to class variables and inputs from the procedure call.
* Instance methods - belong to individual objects, and have access to instance variables for the specific object they are called on, inputs, and class variables.
