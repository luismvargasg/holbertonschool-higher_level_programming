# 0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions

This directory contains all the tasks of the project "0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions" at Holberton School."

## General Objectives

* Why indentation is so important in Python
* How to use the if, if ... else statements
* How to use comments
* How to affect values to variables
* How to use the while and for loops
* How is Pythons for different from Cs?
* How to use the break and continues statements
* How to use else clauses on loops
* What does the pass statement do, and when to use it
* How to use range
* What is a function and how do you use functions
* What does return a function that does not use any return statement
* Scope of variables
* Whats a traceback
* What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them

## Basic Info

### if statements.

In Python you can use the if statements as in C with some minor changes. "if" it's still an "if", "else if" it's now "elif" and "else" it's an "else". As usual you can use as many as elif you want, else and elif are always optional.

### for statements.

The for statement in Python differs a little bit from C, in Python, for statement iterates over the items of any sequence (a list or a string), in the order that they appear in the sequence.

### range Function.

You can use range if you don't need to iterate over a sequence of numbers; the given end point of the range is never part of the generated sequence. For example:

```
range(5, 10)
    5 through 9
```

### break and continue Statements, and else Clauses on Loops.

* The break statement, like in C, breaks out of the smallest enclosing for or while loop.
* The continue statement, also borrowed from C, continues with the next iteration of the loop.
* Loop statements may have an else clause; it is executed when the loop terminates through exhaustion of the list (with for) or when the condition becomes false (with while).

### pass statements.

The pass statement does nothing. It can be used when a statement is required syntactically but the program requires no action.
