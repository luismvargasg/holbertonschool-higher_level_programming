# 0x07. Python - Test-driven development

> This directory contains all the tasks of the project "0x07. Python - Test-driven development" at [Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.com "Holberton School.") for educational purpose.

## General Objectives

* Whats an interactive test.
* Why tests are important.
* How to write Docstrings to create tests.
* How to write documentation for each module and function.
* What are the basic option flags to create tests.
* How to find edge cases.

## Basic info

The doctest module searches for pieces of text that look like interactive Python sessions, and then executes those sessions to verify that they work exactly as shown. There are several common ways to use doctest:

* To check that a modules docstrings are up-to-date by verifying that all interactive examples still work as documented.
* To perform regression testing by verifying that interactive examples from a test file or a test object work as expected.
* To write tutorial documentation for a package, liberally illustrated with input-output examples. Depending on whether the examples or the expository text are emphasized, this has the flavor of literate testing or executable documentation.
